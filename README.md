# smack-toys

Simple programs that exercise features of the Smack Linux security module

These programs are not intended to be important in any way.
They may (or may not) be useful as test cases or the basis for
test cases. They are not intended to be general, and no attempt
has been made to make them safe, secure or correct. There are
older versions of some of these programs floating about, but
these are the "official" versions.
